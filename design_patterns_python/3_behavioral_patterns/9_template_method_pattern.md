The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

In this example, `AbstractClass` is an abstract class that defines the template method, which is the algorithm's skeleton. The `template_method` calls three operations: `_operation1`, `_operation2`, and `_operation3`. The `_operation1` and `_operation3` methods are implemented in the `AbstractClass`, while the `_operation2` method is left unimplemented.

`ConcreteClass1` and `ConcreteClass2` are concrete subclasses that inherit from the `AbstractClass`. They both implement the `_operation2` method differently, and `ConcreteClass2` also overrides the `_operation3` method.

In the main function, two objects are created from `ConcreteClass1` and `ConcreteClass2`. When the `template_method` method is called on these objects, the algorithm's skeleton is executed, and the overridden methods in the subclasses are called accordingly.

This implementation of the Template Method pattern allows subclasses to provide their own implementations of specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. It also encapsulates the algorithm in the base class, making it easier to modify or extend the algorithm in the future.
