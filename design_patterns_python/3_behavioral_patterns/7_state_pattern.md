The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, known as states, and allows the object to change its current state dynamically.

In this example, `State` is an abstract class that defines the interface for all states. The `StartState` and `StopState` classes are concrete implementations of the `State` class that define the behavior of the object when it's in the corresponding state.

The `Context` class represents the object whose behavior can change based on its internal state. It contains a reference to the current state, which can be set or retrieved through its `set_state` and `get_state` methods, respectively. The `do_action` method of the `Context` class delegates the behavior to the current state.

In the `main` function, a `Context` object is created, and its state is initially set to `StartState`. The `do_action` method of the `StartState` object is called, which prints a message and sets the context's state to the `StartState` object. The same process is repeated with the `StopState` object, which changes the context's state to the `StopState` object and prints a different message.

This implementation of the State pattern allows the object's behavior to change dynamically based on its internal state. It also encapsulates the state-specific behavior in separate classes, which makes it easier to add or modify states without affecting the other states or the context object.
