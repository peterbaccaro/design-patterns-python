The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `Command` is an abstract class that defines the interface for executing commands. `Receiver` is a class that provides the functionality that will be executed by the command. `ConcreteCommand` is a class that implements the `Command` interface and encapsulates a `Receiver` object.

`Invoker` is a class that maintains a list of commands and provides a method to execute them. The `main` function creates a `Receiver` object, a `ConcreteCommand` object with the `Receiver` as its parameter, and an `Invoker` object. The `ConcreteCommand` is added to the `Invoker`'s list of commands, and the commands are executed. The output is printed to the console.

This implementation of the Command pattern allows you to encapsulate a request as an object and pass it as a parameter to clients, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It also allows you to change the functionality of the system without affecting the client code.
