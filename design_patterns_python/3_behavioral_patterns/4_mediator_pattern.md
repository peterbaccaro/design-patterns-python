The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without knowing about each other. Instead, they communicate through a mediator object, which encapsulates the communication logic. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `Mediator` is an abstract class that defines the interface for sending messages between objects. `ConcreteMediator` is a class that implements the `Mediator` interface and encapsulates the communication logic between two `Colleague` objects.

`Colleague` is an abstract class that defines the interface for objects that communicate through the mediator. `Colleague1` and `Colleague2` are classes that implement the `Colleague` interface and communicate with each other through the `ConcreteMediator`.

The `main` function creates a `ConcreteMediator` object, creates `Colleague1` and `Colleague2` objects with the `ConcreteMediator` as their parameter, and sends messages between the colleagues using their `send` methods.

This implementation of the Mediator pattern allows objects to communicate with each other without knowing about each other. Instead, they communicate through a mediator object, which encapsulates the communication logic. It also allows you to add new objects to the system without affecting the existing objects or the mediator object.
