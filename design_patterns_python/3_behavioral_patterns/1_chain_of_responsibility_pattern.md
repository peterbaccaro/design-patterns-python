The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests through a chain of handlers, with each handler having the ability to either handle the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `Handler` is an abstract class that defines the interface for handling requests and passing them on to the next handler in the chain. `ConcreteHandler1` and `ConcreteHandler2` are classes that implement the `Handler` interface and handle requests that they are responsible for, or pass the request on to the next handler in the chain if they are not.

`ConcreteHandler2` initializes an instance of `ConcreteHandler1` as its successor. `handle_request` is called on `ConcreteHandler2`, which tries to handle the request itself, or passes the request on to its successor if it cannot handle it.

The `main` function creates `ConcreteHandler1` and `ConcreteHandler2` objects, with `ConcreteHandler2` as the successor of `ConcreteHandler1`. `handle_request` is called on `ConcreteHandler2` with three different requests. The output is printed to the console.

This implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to pass requests through a chain of handlers, with each handler having the ability to either handle the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain. It also allows you to change the order or composition of the handlers without affecting the client code.
