The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create copies of objects without exposing their underlying implementation details. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using the `copy` module or by defining a `clone` method in the class.

In this example, `Prototype` is an abstract class that defines a `clone` method that returns a copy of the object. `Person` is a concrete class that inherits from `Prototype` and defines its own implementation of `__init__` and `__str__`.

The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the object, which is used to print the object to the console. The `main` function creates two `Person` objects, `person1` and `person2`. `person2` is a clone of `person1` created using the `clone` method.

`person2` is then modified by changing its name and age. This modification does not affect `person1`, since `person2` is a separate object.

This implementation of the Prototype pattern allows you to create copies of objects without exposing their underlying implementation details. It also allows you to modify the copied object without affecting the original object.
