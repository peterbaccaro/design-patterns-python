The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

In this example, we have an `Animal` abstract class with a `speak` method, and two concrete classes `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal` and implement the `speak` method. We also have an `AnimalFactory` class with a `get_animal` method that takes an `animal_type` parameter and returns the corresponding `Animal` object.

In the `main` function, an instance of the `AnimalFactory` class is created, and `get_animal` method is called with the desired `animal_type`. The method then returns the corresponding `Animal` object, which is then used to call the `speak` method.

Using this implementation of the Factory Method pattern, we can easily add new `Animal` classes and modify the `AnimalFactory` class to return the appropriate `Animal` object based on the `animal_type` parameter. This keeps the code flexible and easy to maintain.
