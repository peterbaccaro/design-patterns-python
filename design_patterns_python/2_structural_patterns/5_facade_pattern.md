The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `SubsystemA` and `SubsystemB` are two complex subsystems with their own interfaces and implementations. `Facade` is a simplified interface that provides access to the subsystems.

`Facade` initializes instances of `SubsystemA` and `SubsystemB`. `operation` is called on `Facade`, which in turn calls `operation1` and `operation2` on each subsystem and concatenates the results.

The `main` function creates a `Facade` object and calls `operation`. The output is printed to the console.

This implementation of the Facade pattern simplifies the interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use. It also provides a layer of abstraction that isolates the client code from the subsystems, making it easier to change the implementation of the subsystems without affecting the client code.
