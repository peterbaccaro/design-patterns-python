The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. The idea is to create an adapter object that converts the interface of one object into another interface that the client expects.

In this example, `Target` is the interface that the client expects, and `Adaptee` is the incompatible interface. `Adapter` is the class that adapts `Adaptee` to `Target`.

The `Adapter` class takes an instance of `Adaptee` as a parameter in its constructor. The `request` method of `Adapter` calls the `specific_request` method of the `Adaptee`.

When the client calls the `request` method on the `Adapter` object, it is actually calling the `specific_request` method of the `Adaptee` object, but through the adapted `Target` interface.

Note that the `Adapter` class inherits from `Target`, so it has the same interface as the `Target` class, which allows it to be used interchangeably with the `Target` class.
