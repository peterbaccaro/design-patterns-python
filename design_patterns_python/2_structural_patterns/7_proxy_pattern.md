The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `Subject` is an abstract class that defines the interface for `RealSubject` and `Proxy`. `RealSubject` is a class that implements the Subject interface and provides the real functionality of the system. `Proxy` is a class that implements the `Subject` interface and provides a surrogate or placeholder for `RealSubject`.

`Proxy` initializes an instance of `RealSubject`. `request` is called on `Proxy`, which checks access using `_check_access` and returns the result of `RealSubject`'s `request` method if access is granted, or a default string if access is not granted.

The `main` function creates a `Proxy` object and calls `request`. The output is printed to the console.

This implementation of the Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for RealSubject to control access to it. It also allows you to change the implementation of RealSubject without affecting the client code.
