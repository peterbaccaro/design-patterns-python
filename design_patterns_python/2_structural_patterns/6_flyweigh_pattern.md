The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to share objects that are frequently used to save memory and improve performance. In Python, this pattern can be implemented using classes and interfaces.

In this example, `Flyweight` is a class that represents a flyweight object with a shared state and an operation that takes a unique state. `FlyweightFactory` is a class that manages the flyweight objects and returns them to clients.

`FlyweightFactory` initializes an empty dictionary of flyweights. `get_flyweight` takes a shared state as an argument, looks up the shared state in the dictionary of flyweights, and returns the existing flyweight if it exists, or creates a new flyweight if it does not.

The `main` function creates a `FlyweightFactory` object and gets three flyweights with different shared states. The `operation` method is called on each flyweight with a unique state. The output is printed to the console.

This implementation of the Flyweight pattern allows you to share objects that are frequently used to save memory and improve performance. It also allows you to create new objects with different unique states without duplicating objects with the same shared state.
